## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- Spring-RS framework support with minimal example in `/examples`
- Restored CRUD benchmarks from 0.4.5

### Changed

- Moved `crudcrate-derive` and examples into repository
- Simplified framework architecture - removed redundant code generation paths
- Refactored macro code generation by splitting helpers.rs into focused modules
